WedgePrint plugin for WordPress is an easy way to show your readers short-time visual screenshots while loading the requested blog page.

== Description ==

**WedgePrint plugin for wordpress** allows you to show your blog readers **short time visual screen-size messages** before the content actually loads. 
Messages can be funny, commercial or whatever you want. This plugin is in 'beta' phase at the moment, so 'handle with care', which translates into:
be careful in its use. It is recommended to try it first in a *pre-production environment* and closely inspect blog statistics for undesirable effects
the first days in production mode. The plugin controls through 'cookies' the number of messages a reader gets per hour: **now variable!**, so readers don't feel saturated ;)
